Thesis: Modeling of Stochastic Routing for On-Demand Waste Management Applications


Abstract
This thesis investigates the waste collection problem as to how to route vehicles for collection when the concept of emptying-as-needed is introduced. We propose a heuristic with quadratic time complexity that plans routes for the
collection of waste from containers based on a reverse base stock model and parametric filling rates. This heuristic differs from a dynamic waste collection
plan, as we additionally allow for the emptying of nearby non-needed containers. Our approach is illustrated using a theoretical upscaling of a real-life
attempt at waste collection with emptying-as-needed in Glostrup municipality, which is located in Denmark. We clarify that the practice of On-Demand
waste collection is more costly in terms of distance traveled compared to a static waste collection plan and a dynamic waste collection plan, respectively.
The proposed heuristic is shown to be very competitive given the large flexibility of the parameters that consider the trade-off between cost and a balanced
workload. Additionally, we provide a brief history of the literature along with a detailed description of vehicle routing and inventory management for waste
collection purposes, which have been used to develop the proposed heuristic.
